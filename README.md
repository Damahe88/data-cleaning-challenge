# data-cleaning-challenge
## Data Cleaning Methods and exploration

## Branches:

- main -> production
- devenv -> dev environment
- testenv -> test environment

## Features will be developed in feature branches:
- Feature branches are always based on main:
- convention feature/#####_<name>
- feature merges into test
- test merges into main
    
- always possible to merge in devenv to develop

Environment Setup:

Virtuelle environment:

    - python3 -m venv env
    - source env/bin/Activate (for MacOs) / <venv>/Scripts/activate.bat (Windows)
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

### Testing still has to be implemented!
